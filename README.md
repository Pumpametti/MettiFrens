# MettiFrens

Metti Frens is a tutorial designed for artists with 0 coding background to use generative code + Solidity to create NFT collections on 
Fantom Blockchain, list on Artion & Paintswap with minimal fees. 

Fantom is EVM compatible and very fast & smooth and will save emerging artist a lot of gas if you choose to mint in this ecosystem. Granted it's at early days with not as many collectors as the ethereum blockchain, but I believe good artworks will attract more and more collectors. 

More artists will create good art on blockchain once the tech barrier & moat is gradually cleared by the cavaliers and the crazy ones who open-source as much as possible in the WEB 3 new universe.

I will be one of the small crazy ones. 

Helping others to win is anon chad move
