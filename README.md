# MettiFrens

MettiFrens is a tutorial designed for artists with 0 coding background to use generative code + Solidity to create NFT collections on 
Fantom Blockchain, list on Artion & Paintswap with minimal fees.

MettiFrens collection will not be in official art collections of Pumpametti, maybe they have educational historical relic effect, who knows.

In MettiFrens.sol smart contract, there will be a token balance check with a prerequiste of only wallet address that holds more than 10 billion Metti Inu ($Metti) can mint. It's a fair-laucnhed art meme doggo token and I hope you can keep it in to help grow Metti Inu community in the NFT art world. 

You can read about Metti Inu here:

You can use MettiFrens_NoBalanceCheck.sol if you prefer smart contract for your art without $Metti balance check. 

Fantom is EVM compatible and very fast & smooth and will save emerging artist a lot of gas if you choose to mint in this ecosystem. Granted it's at early days with not as many collectors as the ethereum blockchain, but I believe good artworks will attract more and more collectors.

More artists will create good art on blockchain once the tech barrier & moat is gradually cleared by the cavaliers and the crazy ones who open-source as much as possible in the WEB 3 new universe.

I will be one of the small crazy ones. 

Helping others to win is anon chad move!
